## Installation

Download or clone this repository, navigate into the directory and execute
```
pip install .
```

Note that the package requires numpy, scipy, matplotlib, emcee and tqdm.

## Basic usage

```python
from PyToF import ClassToF

X = ClassToF.ToF()
```
**There is an extensive tutorial in PyToF_Tutorial.ipynb that explains all functionalities associated with this class.**

## Accuracy and Convergence

See the folder PyToF_Accuracy_and_Convergence_Images for plots that demonstrate the accuracy of PyToF when compared against
